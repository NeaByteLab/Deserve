# Philosophy

Building servers shouldn't feel like a puzzle. That's how Deserve came to life.

## The Journey

Like many developers, I spent years working across the JavaScript ecosystem with different frameworks. [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) was my go-to — simple, familiar, and reliable. I built countless projects with it. But when Deno entered the scene, something clicked.

Deno offers a powerful native ecosystem. But here's the thing: sometimes "powerful" can feel overwhelming. Config files here, route registrations there, middleware setup everywhere. I wanted something built specifically for Deno that felt simpler for the things I needed to build.

## Core Beliefs

1) **Minimal dependencies, maximum productivity.** Ideally zero dependencies. Deno already provides so much — let's keep things simple.

2) **File structure as API structure.** No route registration needed. Your folder structure becomes your API. Easy for teams and easy to maintain.

3) **Embrace native solutions.** When Deno gives you rich features and request handling out of the box, use them. Build on what's already there instead of starting from scratch.

4) **Developer experience matters.** Code should be readable. Patterns should be predictable. Errors should be helpful. We aim for fast and efficient.

## Not Competing

Deserve isn't trying to replace or compete with massive frameworks. It's a tool for developers who love Deno's simplicity and want a straightforward way to build APIs with less setup overhead.

Sometimes the best solution is the simple one. And sometimes, that simple solution doesn't exist yet. So we built one ourselves.
